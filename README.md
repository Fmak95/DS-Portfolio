This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

# Regression Problems
## Kaggle Competition: "Caterpillar Tube Pricing" (In Progress...)
<a href="https://github.com/Fmak95/Caterpillar-Tube-Pricing/blob/master/Caterpillar_Tubes_Pricing.ipynb">Github</a>

This challenge was issued by Caterpillar: given a dataset containing multiple CSV files that contained information pertaining tube assemblies, predict their price. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/caterpillar-tube-pricing">Kaggle</a>. Dataset consists of many files, so there is an additional challenge in combining the data and selecting the features.

## Kaggle Competition: "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"
<a href="https://github.com/Fmak95/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques/blob/master/House_Prices.ipynb">Github</a>

A classic machine learning problem: based on a variety of household features, predict the price of the house. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">Kaggle</a>. The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation, data visualization, feature engineering and data imputation techniques.
